## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Selection

The application uses `pnemonia_classifier_v2.h5` by default. To use a different model:

1. Place your model file in the `model/` directory
2. Update the model path in `pneumonia_detector.py`:
   ```python
   pneumonia_classifier_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('./model/your_model.h5')
   ```

### Customization

- **UI Theme**: Modify CSS in the `st.markdown()` section
- **Model Parameters**: Adjust image preprocessing settings
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Customize classification thresholds
